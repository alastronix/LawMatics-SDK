# API Endpoint Implementation and Testing Plan

## Phase 1: API Documentation Analysis
[x] Review official API documentation to identify all endpoints
[x] Cross-reference with existing implementations
[x] Identify missing endpoints and create implementation priority list

## Phase 2: Missing Endpoint Implementation
[x] Implement missing endpoints in SDK clients
[x] Ensure proper error handling and validation
[x] Add comprehensive XML documentation

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing
[ ] Create unit tests for all new endpoints
[ ] Test both success and error scenarios
[ ] Ensure all edge cases are covered

## Phase 4: Build and Test Validation
[ ] Verify all projects build successfully
[ ] Run complete test suite
[ ] Fix any failing tests or compilation issues

## Phase 5: Final Verification
[ ] Cross-check implementation against documentation
[ ] Validate request/response models match API specs
[ ] Ensure SDK provides complete API coverage

## Current Status: Fixing Test Runtime Issues
[x] Update test files to match actual model structure
[x] Fix property name mismatches (PostalCode vs ZipCode, etc.)
[x] Update PaginationInfo property references
[x] Remove references to non-existent models/methods
[x] Ensure all tests compile and pass
[ ] Fix JSON deserialization issues in mock responses
[ ] Fix mock HTTP handler setup for failing tests
[ ] Focus on getting core CRUD tests working for main clients

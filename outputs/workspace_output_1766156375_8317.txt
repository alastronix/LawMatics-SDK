# LawMatics C# API SDK Implementation Plan

## Project Setup
- [x] Create .NET 9 class library project (LawMatics.SDK)
- [x] Create .NET 9 unit test project (LawMatics.SDK.Tests) 
- [x] Configure project references and NuGet packages
- [x] Set up solution file and build configuration

## Core SDK Infrastructure
- [x] Implement base LawMaticsClient class
- [x] Create authentication handling (OAuth 2.0 with Bearer tokens)
- [x] Implement HttpClient with proper disposal patterns
- [x] Add retry logic for transient failures
- [x] Create custom exception classes for API errors
- [x] Add logging infrastructure

## API Models and DTOs
- [ ] Create base response and request models
- [ ] Implement Contact models (request/response)
- [ ] Implement Company models (request/response)
- [ ] Implement Matter/Prospect models (request/response)
- [ ] Implement Event/Appointment models (request/response)
- [ ] Implement File and Folder models (request/response)
- [ ] Implement Email Campaign models (request/response)
- [ ] Implement Payment/Invoice models (request/response)
- [ ] Implement Custom Field and Form models (request/response)
- [ ] Implement Note models (request/response)

## API Client Classes
- [ ] Create ContactsClient with CRUD operations
- [ ] Create CompaniesClient with CRUD operations

- [ ] Write tests for UsersClient (success/failure scenarios)

## Documentation and Examples
- [x] Create comprehensive README.md
- [x] Add XML documentation comments to all public APIs
- [x] Create usage examples for common scenarios
- [x] Document authentication setup process
- [x] Document all dependencies and requirements

## Final Verification

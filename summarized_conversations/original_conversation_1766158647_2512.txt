{ex.Message}\\\\");\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Dependency Injection\\\\n\\\\n### ASP.NET Core Integration\\\\n\\\\n```csharp\\\\n// In Program.cs or Startup.cs\\\\nbuilder.Services.AddLawMaticsClient(options =>\\\\n{\\\\n    options.BaseUrl = \\\\"https://api.lawmatics.com\\\\";\\\\n    options.TimeoutSeconds = 30;\\\\n}, credentials =>\\\\n{\\\\n

configuration[\\\\"LawMatics:ClientSecret\\\\"];\\\\n});\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Manual DI Registration\\\\n\\\\n```csharp\\\\n// Register the client as a singleton or scoped service\\\\nservices.AddSingleton<LawMaticsClient>(provider =>\\\\n{\\\\n    var credentials = new LawMaticsCredentials(configuration[\\\\"LawMatics:AccessToken\\\\"]);\\\\n    var options = LawMaticsClientOptions.Production;\\\\n    return new LawMaticsClient(credentials, options);\\\\n});\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Advanced Usage\\\\n\\\\n### Custom Logging\\\\n\\\\n```csharp\\\\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;\\\\n\\\\n// Configure logging\\\\nvar loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder =>\\\\n    builder.AddConsole().SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug));\\\\n\\\\nvar logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<LawMaticsClient>();\\\\n\\\\nusing var client = new LawMaticsClient(credentials, options, logger);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### HTTP Message Handler Customization\\\\n\\\\n```csharp\\\\n// Create a custom message handler\\\\nvar customHandler = new CustomHttpMessageHandler();\\\\n\\\\nusing var client = new LawMaticsClient(credentials, customHandler, options);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Request/Response Interception\\\\n\\\\n```csharp\\\\n// Add custom request headers\\\\nclient.CustomHeaders[\\\\"X-Request-Source\\\\"] = \\\\"MyApp\\\\";\\\\n\\\\n// Monitor API calls\\\\nclient.RequestSent += (sender, args) =>\\\\n{\\\\n    Console.WriteLine($\\\\"Request sent: {args.Method} {args.Uri}\\\\");\\\\n};\\\\n\\\\nclient.ResponseReceived += (sender, args) =>\\\\n{\\\\n    Console.WriteLine($\\\\"Response received: {args.StatusCode}\\\\");\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Models and DTOs\\\\n\\\\nThe SDK includes comprehensive models for all LawMatics entities:\\\\n\\\\n### Contact Model\\\\n```csharp\\\\npublic class Contact\\\\n{\\\\n    public int Id { get; set; }\\\\n    public string? FirstName { get; set; }\\\\n    public string? LastName { get; set; }\\\\n    public string? Email { get; set; }\\\\n    public string? Phone { get; set; }\\\\n    public string?

PostalCode { get; set; }\\\\n    public string? Country { get; set; }\\\\n    \\\\n    public string FullAddress => /* formatted address */;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Pagination\\\\n\\\\nMany API endpoints return paginated results:\\\\n\\\\n```csharp\\\\nvar response = await client.Contacts.GetContactsAsync();\\\\n\\\\nConsole.WriteLine($\\\\"Page {response.Pagination.CurrentPage} of {response.Pagination.TotalPages}\\\\");\\\\nConsole.WriteLine($\\\\"Total contacts: {response.Pagination.Total}\\\\");\\\\nConsole.WriteLine($\\\\"Has next page: {response.Pagination.HasNext}\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Navigate to next page\\\\nif (response.Pagination.HasNext)\\\\n{\\\\n    var nextPage = await client.Contacts.GetContactsAsync(new GetContactsParameters\\\\n    {\\\\n        Page = response.Pagination.CurrentPage + 1,\\\\n        PerPage = response.Pagination.PerPage\\\\n    });\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Rate Limiting\\\\n\\\\nThe SDK automatically handles rate limiting:\\\\n\\\\n```csharp\\\\ntry\\\\n{\\\\n    var result = await client.Contacts.GetContactsAsync();\\\\n}\\\\ncatch (LawMaticsRateLimitException ex)\\\\n{\\\\n    // Automatic retry is handled by the SDK\\\\n    Console.WriteLine($\\\\"Rate limited. Retry after: {ex.RetryAfter}\\\\");\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Testing\\\\n\\\\n### Unit Testing with Mocks\\\\n\\\\n```csharp\\\\nusing Moq;\\\\nusing Moq.Protected;\\\\n\\\\n// Create a mock HTTP handler\\\\nvar mockHandler = new Mock<HttpMessageHandler>();\\\\n\\\\n// Setup mock response\\\\nmockHandler\\\\n    .Protected()\\\\n    .Setup<Task<HttpResponseMessage>>(\\\\n        \\\\"SendAsync\\\\",\\\\n        ItExpr.IsAny<HttpRequestMessage>(),\\\\n        ItExpr.IsAny<CancellationToken>())\\\\n    .ReturnsAsync(new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK)\\\\n    {\\\\n        Content = new StringContent(\\\\"{&quot;data&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Test&quot;}}\\\\")\\\\n    });\\\\n\\\\n// Create client with mock handler\\\\nvar httpClient = new HttpClient(mockHandler.Object);\\\\nvar client = new LawMaticsClient(credentials, httpClient, options);\\\\n\\\\n// Test your code\\\\nvar result = await client.Contacts.GetContactAsync(1);\\\\nAssert.Equal(\\\\"Test\\\\", result.Name);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements\\\\n\\\\n- **.NET 9.0** or later\\\\n- **System.Text.Json** for JSON serialization\\\\n- **Microsoft.Extensions.Http** for HTTP client factory\\\\n- **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions** for logging support\\\\n\\\\n## Dependencies\\\\n\\\\n- `System.Text.Json` (>= 8.0.0)\\\\n- `Microsoft.Extensions.Http` (>= 8.0.0)\\\\n- `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` (>= 8.0.0)\\\\n- `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions` (>= 8.0.0)\\\\n\\\\n## Support\\\\n\\\\n- **Documentation**: [Full API documentation](https://docs.lawmatics.com/)\\\\n- **Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/LawMatics.SDK/issues)\\\\n- **Support Email**: `api@lawmatics.com`\\\\n\\\\n## License\\\\n\\\\nThis SDK is licensed under the MIT License.
